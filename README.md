### WelcomeðŸ‘‹
 I'm a Frontend Developer, experienced in JavaScript and React.
 
 Currently, I'm: 
 - contributing to <a href="https://github.com/Web-Dev-Path">Web Dev Path</a>, an open source project,
 - improving a team project called <a href="https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v40-geckos-team-19">WeDesign</a> from my last <a href='https://www.chingu.io/'>Chingu</a> voyage,
 - collaborating on a <a href="https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-50-smart-shopping-list">Smart Shopping List</a> project with <a href="https://the-collab-lab.codes/"> Collab Lab</a>,
 - participating in Hacktoberfest 2022, contributing to this <a href="https://github.com/webdev-20/TLL-hacktoberfest-2022">URL shortener</a> repo.
 
 My most recent personal project in React is a <a href="https://github.com/klezi10/react-my-dictionary-app">Dictionary App</a>. The app uses state management and two different API integrations.
