### WelcomeðŸ‘‹
 I'm currently learning Frontend Development, focusing on JavaScript and React.
 
 My most recent project in React is a <a href="https://github.com/klezi10/react-my-dictionary-app">Dictionary App</a>. The app uses state management and two different API integrations.
 
 Check out my last project in vanilla JavaScript: <a href="https://github.com/klezi10/random-password-generator">Random Password Generator</a> coded from a Figma design.
