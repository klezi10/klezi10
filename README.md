### WelcomeðŸ‘‹
 I'm a Frontend Developer, focusing on JavaScript and React.
 
 Currently, I'm: 
 - contributing to <a href="https://github.com/Web-Dev-Path">Web Dev Path</a>, an open source project,
 - working on <a href="https://github.com/klezi10/foodster">Food order menu app with Cart using Redux</a>,
 - building and improving a group project in React called <a href="https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v40-geckos-team-19">WeDesign</a>.
 
 My most recent personal project in React is a <a href="https://github.com/klezi10/react-my-dictionary-app">Dictionary App</a>. The app uses state management and two different API integrations.
