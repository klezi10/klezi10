### WelcomeðŸ‘‹
 I'm currently learning Frontend Development, focusing on JavaScript and React.
 
 Check out my last project <a href="https://github.com/klezi10/random-password-generator">Random Password Generator</a> and a coding challenge <a href="https://github.com/klezi10/Coding-Challenge-Tip-Calculator-app">Tip Calculator App</a>, both built in vanilla JavaScript.
